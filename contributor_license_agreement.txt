Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”)
Version 1.0, March 2024

This CLA enables you, the Contributor (“You” or “Contributor”), to submit Contributions to Fraunhofer (“Fraunhofer”), or to have them submitted, and to grant the rights stated below in such Contribution/s in their entirety. This CLA determines which of the Contributor’s rights in their Contributions to Fraunhofer will be granted by the Contributor to Fraunhofer and the conditions that must be observed in that regard. 
By way of conclusion of this CLA, the Contributor accepts the following conditions for their current and future Contributions to Fraunhofer under this CLA. Except for the licenses granted in this CLA to Fraunhofer and the recipients of Works containing such Contribution distributed by Fraunhofer or any third-party authorized by Fraunhofer to do so, the Contributor reserves all rights in their Contributions. 

§ 1 Definitions
(1)	“Contribution” means any work (e.g. source code, object code, bug fixes, configuration changes, tools, specifications, documentation, data, materials, feedback, information or other works of authorship) whether or not protected under copyright, design and/or patent law, including any modifications of or additions to this work as well as adaptations of the work, that are submitted by the Contributor under this CLA as right holder or by parties legally or contractually entitled to do so by right holders to Fraunhofer for inclusion in works developed and distributed by Fraunhofer or any third-party authorized by Fraunhofer to do so. Within the meaning of this definition, “submit” means any form of electronic or written communication or delivery (e.g. upload to the respective repository such as a Github repository) which is intentionally submitted to Fraunhofer to discuss or improve a current or future work or project undertaken by Fraunhofer, including but not limited to communications sent via electronic mailing lists, source code control systems and issue tracking systems; however, communications that the Contributor or any employee specifically named by him/her have clearly marked as “no contribution”, or which are otherwise identified as such in writing, are excluded.
(2)	“Source Code” means the version of the code of the respective Contribution – if the Contribution is a software – in the programming language.
(3)	“Object Code” means the product of a compilation or translation process of the Source Code.

§ 2 Granting of usage rights 
(1)	The Contributor hereby grants, and agrees to grant, to Fraunhofer a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully-paid, royalty-free, transferable license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute the Contributor’s Contributions and such derivative works, with the right to sublicense the foregoing rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees. 
(2)	The above right of use relates to the Contributions, in particular – insofar as the Contribution is a software– their Source Code and Object Code in any and all forms. The above usage rights include – where applicable – design rights. 
(3)	For avoidance of doubt, Fraunhofer is entitled to freely choose the licence conditions (e.g., so-called permissive, copyleft or proprietary licenses) under which a work containing a Contribution is made available and is not bound to specific licences; in particular, Fraunhofer is also entitled to grant third parties rights to a work which are limited compared to rights of use for the Contributions granted above in this Section 2. Limitations arising for Fraunhofer from licensing conditions of further components of a work remain unaffected.

§ 3 Granting of a patent license
(1)	For any patents (including pending patent applications) owned and licensable by the Contributor at the time of the submission of the Contribution, the Contributor hereby grants Fraunhofer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, free of charge, irrevocable patent license with the right to sublicense the foregoing rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, in all rights deriving from the patent to produce, arrange to have produced, use, offer for sale, sell, import and otherwise transfer the work or the respective Contributions. 
(2)	However, this patent license covers only those rights deriving from the patent of the respective Contributor as are indispensable in order not to infringe that patent and only to the extent that the use of the Contributor’s respective Contribution, whether in itself or as a combination with other Contributions of the Contributor or any third parties together with the work for which these Contributions were submitted, would otherwise infringe that patent. For avoidance of doubt, no patent licenses are granted for the use of a Work or the Contribution which become necessary for lawful use because third party modifications are made to the Work or the respective Contribution after the Contribution has been submitted by the Contributor.
(3)	The Contributor is entitled to decide in its own discretion to abandon respectively maintain any patent for which he has granted a patent license in accordance with para. 1 of this Section 3.  

§ 4 Contributor’s binding representations
(1)	You hereby represent that 
a.	You are entitled to grant the usage rights and - to the extent applicable - patent licenses for Contributions under this CLA, and 
b.	by granting usage rights under Section 2 above and patent licenses under Section 3 above, they are not infringing any rights granted by the Contributor to third parties.
(2)	If You wish to submit a third-party work, this must take place separately from any Contribution, in which case the complete details of the source and all licenses or other limitations (including but not limited to any associated patents, trademarks and licensing agreements) which You are aware of must be provided. The corresponding work must be clearly identified as a third-party work when it is submitted.

§ 5 Trademarks
The Contributor does not grant permission to use its trade names, trademarks, service marks or product names.

§ 6 No restriction on other use by the Contributor
The Contributor is expressly permitted to use and exploit the Contributions on a commercial or non–commercial basis – individually, in part or as part of another work – in accordance with the rights held by the Contributor, provided that such other use or exploitation does not conflict with the rights granted under this CLA.

§ 7 Fraunhofer’s obligations 
(1)	Fraunhofer is not obliged to incorporate the Contributor’s Contributions into any work or to use them in any other way. 
(2)	If a work is distributed by Fraunhofer by way of incorporation of the Contributor’s Contributions or if the Contributions themselves are distributed, Fraunhofer is obliged - irrespective of whether the Contributions have been modified by Fraunhofer or any third party - to retain and to oblige the recipients of the work to retain all copyright, patent, trade mark and name credit notices in the Contributions - in the form as distributed - with the exception of those notices that do not pertain to any part of the distributed Contributions.

§ 8 Limitation of liability
Except in cases of intent and gross negligence, the Contributor, its legal representatives, trustees, officers and employees shall not be liable towards Fraunhofer for direct or indirect, material or immaterial losses of any kind arising from the use of the Contributions; this includes but is not limited to loss of goodwill, interruption of production, computer failures or errors, loss of data or economic losses, even if the Contributor has been made aware of the possibility of such losses. Notwithstanding the above, the Contributor shall only be liable under product liability law to the extent that the respective provisions are applicable to the Contributions.
Except in case of intent or gross negligence the Contributor, its legal representatives, trustees, officers and employees shall not be liable that any of the Contributions is free from any claim of infringement of any patent or any other intellectual property right owned by any third party, accurate, devoid of mistakes, complete and/or usable for any purpose.

§ 9 Other provisions
(1)	This CLA is governed by German law, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). Exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes between the parties regarding the interpretation of this CLA is Munich, Germany. This CLA or any provision thereof may be amended or modified only with the mutual consent of Fraunhofer and the Contributor.
(2)	Any failure by Fraunhofer or the Contributor to insist that the other Party adhere to a provision of this CLA in a given situation does not affect the right of such Party to require adherence in the same regard at a later date. Waiving compliance with a provision in one situation shall not be deemed a waiver of compliance with that provision in the future or as a waiver of the provision in its entirety.
(3)	If any provision of this CLA should prove to be invalid and unenforceable, then the validity of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. In this case, that provision will be replaced, as far as possible, by an enforceable provision that most closely reflects the meaning of the original provision.
